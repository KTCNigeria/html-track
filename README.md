# <p align="center">Task Seven - The Finale</p>

If you've gotten to this task, then congratulations. You've just been able to learn the fundamentals of HTML, and you're getting closer to building your first complete site. But there is one last task you need to complete...

### Your Task
- Using all the knowledge you've gained so far, create a small landing page for a brand.
- It should have a hero section (know more about heros [here](https://www.awebco.com/blog/hero-section/))
- It should display what this brand does, and how to reach them, what they offer e.g contact links
- Some examples of brands you could use are fashion stores, e-commerce sites or even personal websites.
- It isn't compulsory to add styling as that hasn't been discussed here yet. But if you feel a little advanced, you can add some basic styling.

If you find any aspect of this task confusing, feel free to ask your questions in the community as there are always people to offer help.
