# <p align="center">Task Six - Divs</p>

Divs help to seperate content of our webpage into different sections. It helps to group styling, and also group inline elements like `<a>`, `<img>`, `<span>` e.t.c

### Your Task
- Create a tribute page to someone. It could be an athelete you admire, a hero from a movie or cartoon, and so on
- Using `<div>` tag, separate the profile info, achievements of that person, social links and images.
- It should be well organised and contain detailed information.

As usual, be creative, and give it your best shot
